### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Whoa! You've stumbled upon my github profile! Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜„

## Who am I?
My name is **William Qi**, and I'm a senior at Mother Margaret Mary High School and an upcoming CS undergraduate at the University of Alberta. I've been working with **Java** after having experimented with and creating projects with **Node.js** the past few years, and I'm volunteering for [@MoonCraft-Games](https://github.com/Mooncraft-Games) as a Java Software Developer.
Outside of programming, I love playing Minecraft and StarCraft II because I enjoy the creative and strategic aspects of both games!
